title: Meta-Learning the Inductive Biases of Simple Neural Circuits
description: 
    Animals learn from incomplete information and generalize using Occam's razor. This paper introduces a neural network tool that learns the inductive bias of neural circuits by identifying functions they find easy to generalize. The tool recovers known biases and interprets connectomic data, providing insights into the role of neural functionality.
