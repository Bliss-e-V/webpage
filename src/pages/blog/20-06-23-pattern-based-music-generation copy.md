title: Pattern-Based Music Generation with Wasserstein Autoencoders and PRC Descriptions
description: 
    Even with modern technology, artificially generating music indistinguishable from human creations proves to be challenging. This paper describes a new approach by learning patterns commonly found in music using autoencoders and a novel sampling strategy. They trained their method on a newly created dataset.

    Further reading includes the longer version of the paper called "CONLON A PSEUDO-SONG GENERATOR BASED ON A NEW PIANOROLL, WASSERSTEIN AUTOENCODERS, AND OPTIMAL INTERPOLATIONS".

Even with modern technology, artificially generating music indistinguishable from human creations proves to be challenging. This paper describes a new approach by learning patterns commonly found in music using autoencoders combined with a novel sampling strategy for creating smooth transitions between learned patterns.
The authors train and evaluate their methods on a newly created dataset.
