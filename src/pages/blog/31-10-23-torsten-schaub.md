Prof. Torsten Schaub will give an introduction into knowledge driven AI. This is a field of AI which utilizes knowledge to discover solutions. If you are interested you can have a look at [https://potassco.org](https://potassco.org). 
The basic idea of this approach is to not tell the computer has to do but instead to describe the solution and let everything else happen automatically.
