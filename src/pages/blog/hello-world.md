Hey everyone and welcome to the first ever **AITU** blog post ğŸš€. I am incredibly happy to be writing these words today, because it means we are very close to our first meeting, which will mark the official start of the organisation.

In this small post I want to explain some of the thoughts behind the founding of this new organisation, as well provide some insight into what has been happening behind-the-scenes to kick-off the organisation.
