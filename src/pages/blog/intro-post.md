Hey everyone and welcome to the first ever **AITU** blog post 🚀. I am incredibly happy to be writing these words today, because it means we are very close to our first meeting, which will mark the official start of the organisation. In this small post I want to explain some of the thoughts behind the founding of this new organisation, as well provide some insight into what has been happening behind-the-scenes to kick-off the organisation.

### 🧑‍🚀 How it all started

---

As a data science student at **ITU**, learning about AI is envitable. For us, the three founding members of **AITU** (Mika, Ludek and Lukas), this was during the machine learning course. While it felt great to learn about AI, we soon realised that we just saw the tip of an iceberg and that there is much more to learn. So we did. In the Deep Learning course, we got to learn about `Transformers`, architecture introduced in the ground breaking paper [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). (catchy, heh? 💯) Being able to understand state-of-the-art technology felt great and all of the sudden reading research papers started to feel enjoyable. Yet, reading them alone felt boring. And that's when Mika came to us with the proposal of **AITU** - organisation that will enable students like us learn about and discuss state-of-the-art AI methods. Today, it is exactly two months since the initial idea and I am more than happy to say that we are ready for the very first meeting of **AITU**! 🥳

### 🤖 AITU Activites

---

**AITU** is built around three main activities. First, in our **weekly reading group** we go over and discuss one selected research paper. The selection is solely based on preferences of the current **AITU**'s members. Second, in the future, we plan to prepare **projects** for our members and participate in various **competitions**. Last but not the least, we will also **host talks** from academia and industry. If this all sounds exciting and you believe that you
would be a valuable member of AITU, feel free to [write to us](https://aitu.group/join)!

### 📆 First event

---

During our first event, we go back to the very beginning of our journey and read [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). While the paper was released already 6 years ago, it is a cornerstone of many current state-of-the-art methods including **OpenAI**'s family of large language models. (`GPT`) Therefore, it is worth revisiting it before our future endeavours into some more unknown waters. 💫
