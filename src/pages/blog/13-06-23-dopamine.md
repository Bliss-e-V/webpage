title: Dopamine and temporal difference learning - A fruitful relationship between neuroscience and AI
description: 
    Learning and motivation involve internal and external rewards, with behaviors being influenced by the anticipation of positive outcomes. The study of how organisms, including Ivan Pavlov's famous dog experiment, learn to predict rewards has been a productive field for over a century. Recent scientific advancements have allowed researchers to understand the brain's mechanisms behind reward learning, while computer scientists have developed algorithms that enable artificial systems to learn through reinforcement and reward predictions.
